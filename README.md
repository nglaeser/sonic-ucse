# Sonic UC-SE

This crate is an implementation of **Sonic**, a protocol for quickly verifiable, compact zero-knowledge proofs of arbitrary computations. Sonic is intended to be an alternative to zk-SNARKs which typically require a trusted setup for each individual computation. Sonic is _universal_ in that it requires a single setup, and _updateable_ in that the parameters can be continually strengthened. In exchange, Sonic proofs are slightly longer and slightly slower to verify in practice.

**THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS A PROTOTYPE AND IS FULL OF BUGS, DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION**
